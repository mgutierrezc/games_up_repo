Ultimatum game with two treatments: direct response and strategy method.
In the former, one player makes an offer and the other either accepts or rejects.
It comes in two flavors, with and without hypothetical questions about the second player's response to offers other than the one that is made.
In the latter treatment, the second player is given a list of all possible offers, and is asked which ones to accept or reject.
