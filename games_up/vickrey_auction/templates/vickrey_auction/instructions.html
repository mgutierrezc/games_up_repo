        Instructions
    </h3>

    <p>
        You have been randomly and anonymously matched with 2 other
        participants in an auction. Each of you is given {{ Constants.endowment }} to start.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before bidding, you will learn the value of the object to you.
        The value of the object differs from participant to participant and is
        randomly and independently drawn from 0 to {{ Constants.endowment }} for each participant.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next, you will privately submit a bid for the object.
        You can bid from 0 to {{ Constants.endowment }}.
        The participant with the highest bid wins the object and pays the second highest bid.
        In the event of a die, the winner will be chosen randomly
        will select the winner in the event of a tie bid and the winner will
        pay the highest bid other than her or his own bid.
    </p>
    <p>
        The payoff of the winner is calculated as<br/>
        <strong>
            Winnerâ€™s payoff = {{ Constants.endowment }} + Private value of the object to the winner - Second highest bid
        </strong><br/>
        The payoffs for others are the initial {{ Constants.endowment }}.
    </p>
    <p>
        For your convenience, these instructions will remain available to you on all subsequent screens of this study.
